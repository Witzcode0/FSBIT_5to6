What is a function?

A function is a self-contained block of code designed to perform a specific, well-defined task. It allows for the modularization and reusability of code within a program.

Syntax:

data_type function_name(para1, para2,....paran){
    // code
};

function call

function_name(val1, val2, ..., valn);

recursive function:

A recursive function in C is a function that calls itself, either directly or indirectly, to solve a problem. This technique is particularly useful for problems that can be broken down into smaller, self-similar subproblems.
