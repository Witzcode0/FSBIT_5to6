What is for loop?

A for loop in C is a control flow statement used for iterative execution of a block of code. It is particularly useful when the number of iterations is known or can be determined beforehand. 

syntax:

for(initilization, condition, inc/dec|update value of initilization){
    block of code
}

Example:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int table = 4;
    for(int start = 1; start <= 10; start++){
        printf("%d * %d = %d \n",table, start, table*start);
    }
    
    

    return 0;
}
