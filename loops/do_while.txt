What is do-while loop? [Exit condition]

The do-while loop in C is a control flow statement that executes a block of code at least once, and then repeatedly executes it as long as a specified condition remains true.

syntax:

do{
   block of code 
}while(condition)

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    
    int start = 1, end = 10, table=51;
    
    do{
        printf("Squr: %d | Cube: %d\n",start*start , start*start*start);
       
        start++;
    }while(start <= end);
    
    

    return 0;
}
